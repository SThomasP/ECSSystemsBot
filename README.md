# ECSSystemsBot
Twitter Bot for ECS Systems

Reasonably simple, python twitter bot, designed to monitor and tweet about the status of the ECS Systems Hardware.

I deleted the bot account itself some time ago, but source code should still be fully functional and just require a new twitter account and app.

The following 3rd party python libraries have been used in this bot
* [tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/)
